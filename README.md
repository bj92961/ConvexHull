## Convex Hull implemented in Python
Implement Convex Hull algorithm in Python. Before applying the algorithm, the data points has to be sorted according to x-axis from low to high. I decided to use heap sort to sort the data.
* Input:  a set of two-dimensional points
* Output:  a list of convex hull points
